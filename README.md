CodeWars Solutions

Welcome to my Codewars solutions repository.

Codewars offers a wide range of problems called "kata" that vary in difficulty from 8 kyu (the easiest) to 1 kyu (the most challenging). These katas are a great way to improve problem-solving skills and learn new algorithms and programming concepts.

### Progress Table

The table below shows my current progress on Codewars challenges by kyu level:

| Kyu Level | Number of Completed Katas |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| 8 kyu     | 10                        |
| 7 kyu     | 8                         |
| ...       | ...                       |
| 1 kyu     | 0                         |

*Total Katas Completed: 18*
